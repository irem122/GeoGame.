## 🎯 Core Game Mechanic: The Treasure Hunt

GeoTreasure takes the concept of global discovery and wraps it in a "treasure hunt" adventure. The system randomly selects a target country for each round. You must identify this country based on provided clues and **click it on the map** before the 60-second timer runs out.

## 💻 Technology Stack

This project is built on standard web technologies with a focus on powerful GIS visualization libraries to handle the complex map data.

| Library | Primary Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Leaflet.js** | **Core Mapping Library.** Handles map creation, rendering of clickable country polygons, and managing map interactions (panning, zooming). |
| **GeoJSON** | **Spatial Data Handling.** Used to load the geographical boundaries of all countries, allowing them to be displayed as interactive layers on the map. |
| **D3.js** | **Data Visualization.** Utilized to create dynamic and clear statistics graphs on the end-game screen, showing the user's performance breakdown. |
